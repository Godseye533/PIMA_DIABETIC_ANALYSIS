# PIMA_DIABETIC_ANALYSIS : 
# This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

 1.IMPORTING DATASET AND IMPORTANT LIBRARIES
 
 2.There are "0" values in the rows where there cannot be "0" , so we fill them with the column median
 
 3.TRAINING THE MODEL
 
 4.Getting the Optimum Random State value so that every time the same test train split is done for the optimum accuracy value.
